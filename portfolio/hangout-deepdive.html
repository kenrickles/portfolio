                    <p>At Rocket Academy, we are taught to seek out problems that we can solve with software engineering and go therefore and create those solutions. As such, we are given autonomy to choose our projects with conditions that we need to use certain technologies. </p>
                    
                            <p>I always start out my projects by thinking what are the current problems that I face on a day to day basis, think of how technology can be used to solve the problem. Thereafter, design the end to end user stories, the Entity Relationship Diagrams and thereafter bring the solution to life.</p>
                        <p>
                            <h5>Problems derived from pain points:</h5> 
                            <strong>Micro / Personal Level</strong>:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    One pain I face with my friend group is whenever we want to meet for a meal, we do not know where to go and the answer we always arrive to is always a safe choice. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    At times, we are unable to meet the minimum pax to get the discount, due to busy schedules of my friends, or friends who cancel on the eleventh hour, which is annoying and at times make me feel as though I am spending more money than i should. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I don't know what i don't know. In essences, if i don't know about a deal/promotion, i am unable to utilise it. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Meeting new people. As we get older, it's harder and harder to meet new people to become friends with or a significant other.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Macro Level</strong>:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Industries are suffering from a reduced margin due to aggregators's predatory middle man fees. Online aggregators like Agoda and Priceline provides the hotel industry with a significant percentage of their guests (Kessler & Weed, 2015) and as a result, they leech away huge level of margins via the middleman commission fee.</p> 
                                    <p>Hotels are increasingly seeing it to be a problem and Hilton has been taking steps to take the power back from these aggregators in the long run (Kirkham, 2017). The restaurants industry suffers from this as well. With Third-party ordering platforms like Grubhub and Swiggy takes a commission of anywhere between 15% to 40% for every order (Fisher, 2019).
                                    </p> 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To address these marco, micro and personal pain points, I came up with Hangout?.</p>
<p>
    Hangout?'s purpose is to <strong>allow users to meet new people</strong>, join an activity together and if possible, <strong>save money</strong> while doing it.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Monetisation</strong>: Merchants will be charged a monthly subscription fee based with an entire backend dedicated to them being able to control and upload their own promotions/deals. Users will be able to use the app for free as well as join a paid monthly subscription which allow them access to subscription only deals. Hangout will also monetise by leveraging on aggregated user data. Data is a hidden currency that more companies are beginning to pick up on.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>target audience</strong> is segmented into two groups:
<ol>
    <li>
        People who wish to connect with new people based on interest.
    </li>
    <li>
        People who wish to save money with friends and/or with new people. 
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    As the vision of the app is huge, I cannot do this alone as this seems more like a startup idea than  a simple project for one person.
</p>
<p>
    With a timeframe of 2 weeks, and working with a fellow Rocket Academy student, Alvin, we decided that the minimal viable product would be to:
    <ol>
        <li>
        Allowing the users to <strong>view, create, join, leave, edit and delete</strong> an activity
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow the users will also be able to <strong>message one another in groups in real time</strong>.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    Alvin and I pair-programmed to design the user stories, user journey, wireframes, ERD and decided on the technologies to adopt before starting on writing a single line of code. 
</p>
<br>
<h5>Main User Stories:</h5>
<p>
    Base level for users to access the platform. Users will require an account and need to login with the account.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Login</strong>:
    A User should be able to enter username and password on the Login Page to access the platform.
</pr>
<p>
    <strong>
        Registration </strong>:
    A User should be able to fill up a registration form with a unique email.
</pr>
<p>
    <strong>
        Create Activity</strong>:
        Users should be able to create an activity, edit and delete an activity with the ability to choose the number of participants to join the activity.
</pr>
<p>
    <strong>
        Joining activities</strong>:
        Users should be able to join or leave activities they did not create.
</pr>
<p>
    <strong>
        Chat within group</strong>:
        Users should be able to send messages and receive messages.
</pr>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <h5>
        Technologies we chose to adopt:
    </h5>
We decided to separate the frontend of the app and the backend separately.
<p>
    <strong>Frontend</strong>: React.js, Javascript, React Router
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Backend</strong>: Node.js, Express, Sequelize, Postgres (For storing the user information, Firebase Real-time database (For messaging)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Deployment</strong>: Heroku
</p>
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <h5>Takeaways from this project:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Being unable to set cookies after deploying, we realised that it was due to the fact that Heroku was listed on the public suffix and such we had to buy a custom domain and deploy it as such.</p> 
            <p>
                Being unwilling to pay more than i have to, due to the fact that Heroku requires you to pay at least USD 7 a month to being able to use a custom domain name, that would mean we have to pay for 2 apps, since we chose to deploy two separate apps. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The solution i found to this was to deploy the front-end on Netlify.  As i was unable to find consolidated information on this, i wrote a <a href="https://unparagonedwisdom.medium.com/how-to-use-taggun-api-node-js-with-axios-postman-f35250504ff3"> medium article </a> about it. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Firebase noSQL real-time database was something that I had no experience in before this project and it was a new technology that i really enjoyed learning to use.
        </li>
    </ol>
